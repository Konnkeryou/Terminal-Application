On the Screen there are a number of dashes, equivalent to the length of the secret word. The goal is to correctly guess the secret word. If a guessing player correctly guesses a letter that is in the secret word, the computer will place that letter in the right place in one of the dashes. If the letter does not appear in the secret word, then the computer will draw one element of a Hangman's Gallows. As the game continues, a feature of the Gallow and a victim is added for every incorrect guess not in the secret word. The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends with the victim hanged is seven.
