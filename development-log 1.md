For my Terminal Application i've decided to create a HangMan game. At the moment i'm at the planning stage. Working out my structure and using Trello to organised and designate time to the required task. My plan to fulfill the minimum required functions are: 
Random Question generator, Hangman Graphic for when they guessed the wrong words and a game difficulty feature. The application will be able to run in any terminal without any add-ons.
